# Eden-Geth

Eden is an optional, non-consensus breaking transaction ordering protocol for Ethereum blocks which allows network participants to guarantee placement and protection from arbitrary reordering. The system offers a transparent and fair set of rules to order transactions within each block. An accompanying token reward system realizes MEV profits to block producers to maximize network security.

## Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/eden-network/eden-geth
cd eden-geth
make geth
```
